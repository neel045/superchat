# Getting Started

## Requirements

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    -   You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) instead of `npm`
    -   You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
        -   `yarn --version` and get an output like: `x.x.x`
        -   You might need to [install it with `npm`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) or `corepack`

# Setup

1. clone this git repository

```
git clone https://github.com/neel045/superchat.git
```

2. Setup environment variables:

-   create a `.env` file inside the root directory not in `src`
    set up all this variables inside the `.env` file

3. start servers

    Install node modules and setup the env variables from your own firebase project from firebase console

    ```
    cd superchat
    yarn install
    yarn dev
    ```
